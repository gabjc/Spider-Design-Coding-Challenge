# Coding Challenge Submission - Gabriel

Hello Spider Design Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to complete the coding challenge for the Full-Stack Software Engineer (Entry-Level) position. I have developed a React-based Air Fryer Interest Form that aligns with Spidr Designâ€™s visual identity (at least I think), incorporating the Raleway font and a color scheme inspired by your website.

Deployed App: https://[your-app-url].vercel.app

The form includes all required fields with validation, field error handling, a PIN visibility toggle, and console logging on submission. I tried to utilize good coding practices through using a FormField component which is what every field uses.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Gabriel

# Coding Challenge Submission - Gabriel

Hello Spidr Design Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to do this challenge for the entry level Software Engineer position. I have developed this React/NextJS web page with an interest form component that follows Spidr Designâ€™s visual identity (at least I think), utilizing the Raleway font and a color scheme inspired by your website.

There may be some issues when going to the domain as it redirects to spidr.design due to the name. Just ignore it!

Deployed App: https://spidr-design-coding-challenge.vercel.app/

The form includes all required fields with validation, field error handling, a PIN visibility toggle, and console logging when submitting. I tried to utilize good coding practices through using a FormField component which is what every field uses.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Gabriel
